# What I Learned from This Project

## 1. Don't Try to Be Perfect Right Away
I didn't try to make everything perfect from the start. Instead, I broke the work into 3 parts:

- **Getting the data ready**: Writing the main code and getting the right data
- **Making cool graphs**: This was the fun part - seeing the charts come to life
- **Making it better**: Cleaning up the code and adding better comments

## 2. Check the Simple Things First
Problem 4.1 took me a whole day to fix. I kept getting errors saying provinces didn't exist. I checked my code over and over but couldn't find the problem. I almost gave up!

Then I opened the CSV file in Excel and found there was an extra empty column that I missed. Sometimes the answer is simpler than you think.

## 3. I Really Hate Key Errors
They're the worst. üò§

# What's in This Project

This project has one Google Colab notebook with code blocks that you run in order. Each block uses the results from the one before it.

The notebook is set up like this:
- Each question is clearly marked
- The code to solve it comes right after
- I added lots of comments to explain what's happening

# How to Run This

## What You Need
- Google Colab
- The CSV files

## Steps

1. **Upload Your Files**  
   Put the CSV files in the first code block.

2. **Run the Code in Order**  
   Run each block one after the other, don't skip any.

   > ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**: Each block needs the results from the blocks before it. If you skip around, things will break.

3. **Read the Comments**  
   I wrote explanations for each step to help you understand what's happening.
