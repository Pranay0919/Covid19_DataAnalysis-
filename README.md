## File Structure

This project includes a single Google Colab notebook containing sequential code blocks. 
Each block builds upon the previous one to solve the problems outlined in the case study. 

Every question is listed followed by the code block providing the solution. 
The solution is filled with comments explaining the solution.

## Run Instructions

1. **Load CSV Files**  
   Upload the required CSV files in the **first code block** of the notebook.

2. **Run Code Blocks Sequentially**  
   Execute each subsequent code block **in the order they appear**.

   > ⚠️ **Important:** Each block depends on the outputs or transformations from the previous ones.  
   > Skipping or reordering blocks may lead to errors or incorrect results.
