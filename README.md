## Run Instructions

1. **Load CSV Files**  
   Upload the required CSV files in the **first code block** of the notebook.

2. **Run Code Blocks Sequentially**  
   Execute each subsequent code block **in the order they appear**.

   > ⚠️ **Important:** Each block depends on the outputs or transformations from the previous ones.  
   > Skipping or reordering blocks may lead to errors or incorrect results.
